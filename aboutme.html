    <p><b>Bio:</b> I am a fabulous cosplayer as you can see in my picture above :^)) I enjoy CS, putting orange/red colored flowers in my hair, and opening the gate to the abyss in my mouth. Please don't be afraid of my vacant stare, I promise I'm not dead inside!</p>
    <p></p>
    
    <p><b>Likes:</b> Video games + hiking + the occasional anime. Oh and rock climbing :D <br>
      <b>Dislikes:</b> There's this person sitting down reading my bio judging me and I kinda feel unconfortab--I MEAN DISLIKES?? HAHA WASPS KINDA SUCK RIGHT? I HATE WASPS<br>
    </p>
    
      <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> I've played in a tournament online streamed to over 150,000 concurrent viewers!<br></p>
    
      <p><b>Favorite Websites:</b>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>: I'd almost like to say this is my least favorite because of all the time it takes away from me. It's a love-hate relationship</li>
        <li><a href="https://stackexchange.com/">stackexchange.com</a>: I'd have never made it past the first step of my CS career path without this site, honestly they should just change Computer Science to Stack Exchange Expert</li>
    </ul>

      <p><b>Recent Projects:</b><br><br>
      <b>Connect 4 -</b><br>
      I actually made an AI that you can play connect 4 with on a grid last quarter for my AI class. It was probably the most fun programming project I've done so far because at the end of the quarter we had a competition between everyone and whoever came out on top got 5% extra credit for their grade in the class. And my baby beat them all >:)<br><br>
